      <description>Below is my current setup for my Proxmox Backup Server. As you can see, this isn’t “enterprise-grade” hardware. This is consumer-grade hardware, but this is for a homelab with noise being the major factor. This saves me in electricity and also in noise level.

      <description>This is the hardware list that I have used to build my own &amp;ldquo;servers&amp;rdquo;. Please note that this is all consumer-grade hardware, but is perfect for my setup: Less power, noise, and heat. Keep in mind that I have bought/built two of these machines. They are slightly different, but they both have AMD CPUs, one is a Ryzen and the other is an FX. Both have 8vCPUs, 32GB Memory, 2TBs HD space.</description>
