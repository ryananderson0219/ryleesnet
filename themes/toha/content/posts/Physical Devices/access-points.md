### Ubiquiti Access Points

I currently have three Ubiquiti APs setup in my home. One upstairs and two downstairs. They serve out 4 different SSIDs on different VLANs.

- Main Network SSID
  - Endpoint VLAN - Access to everything
- Guest SSID
  - Guest VLAN - Internet Access Only
- IoT SSID
  - IoT VLAN - Internet Access Only
- Security Camera SSID
  - SEC VLAN - Access to only 1 internal server and no access to the outside world
